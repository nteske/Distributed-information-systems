    get-composite-hotel:
      description: Returns a composite view of the specified hotel id
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        If the requested hotel id is found the method will return information regarding:
        1. Hotel information
        1. Reviews
        1. Location
        1. Rooms
        1. Service Addresses
        (technical information regarding the addresses of the microservices that created the response)
        
        # Expected partial and error responses
        1. If no hotel information is found, a <b>404 - Not Found</b> error will be returned
        1. In no location, reviews or rooms are found for a hotel, a partial response will be returned

    create-composite-hotel:
      description: Creates a composite hotel
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        The composite hotel information posted to the API will be splitted up and stored as separate hotel-info, location, room and review entities.
        # Expected error responses
        1. If a hotel with the same hotelId as specified in the posted information already exists,
           an <b>422 - Unprocessable Entity</b> error with a "duplicate key" error message will be returned
    
    delete-composite-hotel:
      description: Deletes a hotel composite
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        Entities for hotel information, location, rooms and reviews related to the specificed hotelId will be deleted.
        The implementation of the delete method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called several times with the same response.
        This means that a delete request of a non existing hotel will return <b>200 Ok</b>.
